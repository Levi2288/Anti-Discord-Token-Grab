# Anti-Discord-Token-Grab


###Features:

- Works on `Discord`, `DiscordPTB`, `DiscordCanary` & BetterDiscord
- Good randomazition 
- Auto check and Install, Uninstall dependencies like Node.js
- Auto elevate permission
- Dummy friendly

### How it works?

Most of the token grabbers read out your token from `%APPDATA%/discord/Local-Storage` or from the data stored in your browser (same method btw just reads out the file and search for the token)
So this program changes the discord directory to a randomly generated one so it can be harder/impossible for grabbers to steal your data.

THIS TOOL WILL WORK WITH MOST OF THE GRABBERS BUT OFC THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, ITS NOT GONNA PROTECT U FROM GOOD TOOLS THAT USE DIFFERENT.
But most public grabbers use the method listed above so i can help a LOT.

The original main idea was from [zimzika](https://github.com/zimzika), he was the one who came up with this solution i just improved hes code and added a bunch of things to make it better
