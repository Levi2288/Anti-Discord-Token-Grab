# Anti-Discord-Token-Grab

pls ‚≠ê the repo

### Features

- :o: Works on `Discord`, `DiscordPTB`, `DiscordCanary` & BetterDiscord
- :shield: Good randomazition for max security
- :robot: Auto check and Install, Uninstall dependencies like Node.js
- :bulb: Dummy friendly
- :spaghetti: Spaghetti code XD

### How it works?

Most of the token grabbers read out your token from `%APPDATA%/discord/Local-Storage` or from the data stored in your browser (same method btw just reads out the file and search for the token)
So this program changes the discord directory to a randomly generated one so it can be harder/impossible for grabbers to steal your data.



### Warning

:bangbang:THIS TOOL WILL WORK WITH MOST OF THE GRABBERS BUT OFC THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS,:bangbang:

:bangbang:ITS NOT GONNA PROTECT U FROM GOOD TOOLS THAT USE DIFFERENT METHODS.:bangbang:

But most public grabbers use the method listed above so it can help a f LOT.

The original main idea was from [zimzika](https://github.com/zimzika), he was the one who came up with this solution i just improved hes code and added a bunch of things to make it better
